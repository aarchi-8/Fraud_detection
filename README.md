# Fraud_detection
A system that can classify if a transaction is fraudulent or not Using Machine Learning Models.


ðŸ§  Overview:
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning algorithms. I used a structured transactions dataset and applied data preprocessing, feature analysis, and multiple classification models (like Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression) to build a fraud detection system with high accuracy and reliability.

The goal is to detect unusual or suspicious activities, like transactions with abnormal amounts or locations, and flag them as potentially fraudulent.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

ML Algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, NaÃ¯ve Bayes

ðŸ”„ End-to-End Project Workflow:
ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded a transaction dataset

Dropped irrelevant columns like names and IDs

Checked for missing values (none were found)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Boxplots and Histograms to detect outliers and visualize feature distribution

Fraudulent transactions often appear as outliers with unusually high amounts or frequency

ðŸ”¹ 3. Encoding & Feature Scaling
Applied Label Encoding for categorical columns (e.g., transaction type, location)

Used StandardScaler to scale numerical features

ðŸ”¹ 4. Correlation Analysis
Used heatmaps to find relationships between features

"Is_Fraud" label showed low correlation with individual features, indicating complex fraud behavior

ðŸ”¹ 5. Model Training & Evaluation
Split dataset: 75% for training, 25% for testing

Trained several models:

Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, etc.

Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Best models achieved ~94.88% accuracy

ðŸ”¹ 6. Model Comparison
Used bar charts to visualize model performance

Emphasized the importance of precision and recall over just accuracy (to minimize false negatives)
